Description: Estimates avian flight performance parameters and flight energy cnsumption in a 
    3-dimensional space by implementing the basic theory of aerodynamics whilst taking into 
    consideration the effectof wind on flight. It takes inspiration from the program 'Flight',
    developed by Colin Pennycuick (Pennycuick (2008), "Modelling the flying bird". Amsterdam: 
    Elsevier. ISBN 0-19-857721-4) and the 'afpt'R-Package developed by Marco KleinHeerenbrink 
    (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=afpt). Flight performance is estimated based on basic
    morphological measurements such as body mass, wingspan and wing area. 'FlightSim' can be 
    used to make predictions on how much energy is required and used by birds during flight.
